## Overview
This project develops a robust heart attack prediction model leveraging AI techniques, specifically SVM (Support Vector Machine) with a linear kernel. 
The model is designed to accurately assess the probability of a heart attack based on patient data with a 85% accuracy. Key components include data preprocessing, 
model training, evaluation with train-test-validation splits, and integration into a Flask web application featuring an engaging and responsive user interface.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes data scaling for normalization.
- **Model Training**: Utilizes SVM with a linear kernel for classification.
- **Data Splitting**: Dataset is split into train, test, and validation sets.
- **Visualization**: Interactive plots for data insights and model evaluation.
- **Flask Integration**: Web application for uploading data and receiving predictions.
- **User Interface**: Engaging and responsive interface design.

## Project Structure
- **`model/`**: Contains pkl file for the trained model.
- **`templates/`**: HTML files for layout
- **`static/`**: CSS files and assets
- **`app.py`**: Flask integration with model
